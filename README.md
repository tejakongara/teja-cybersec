#This report is an analysis of the companyâ€™s digital assets, specifically the operating systems employed (Microsoft Windows XP and Linux), I have identified several issues of concern. This assessment is a full report of the penetration test employed, that highlights not just the methods employed for testing, but also the weaknesses detected, followed by recommended action needed to be taken to ensure enhanced security of digital assets.
This penetration test was performed between 01/15/2020 and 04/04/2020, essentially documenting my findings in this time period. The vulnerabilities identified have been broken down into categories ranging from high risk, medium risk to low risk. This I believe would be beneficial in prioritizing and addressing these risks, most of which do not require high-tech or expensive solutions.
Finally, the Penetration Test was conducted in multiple stages which have been documented suitably and solutions employing multiples lines of defense have been suggested. This I believe will help the company ensure short-term as well as long-term security of digital assets.
